# Feedback panel

Use the feedback panel component when you want to ask the user to provide feedback on a page or section of a page.

{{ designSystemExample({
"iframe": {
    "title": "An example of the feedback panel component",
    "url": "example.html",
    "size": "s"
},
"component": {
    "name": "feedback-panel"
}
}) }}

It works well when included at the bottom of the page, after the main content. Putting it after the main content means it won't distract the user from the content before they have had chance to read it.
