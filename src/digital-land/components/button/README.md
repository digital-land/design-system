### Secondary page action button

Use these buttons when there is a page wide action a user is able to perform, which is not a main call to action. Examples include:

* a button to print the page (as seen on [GOV.UK](http://gov.uk))
* a button to download the data behind a page

    "title": "An example of a secondary action button",
    "url": "example-page-action.html",
    "size": "xs"
},
"example": {
    "path": "digital-land/components/button"
}
}) }}
