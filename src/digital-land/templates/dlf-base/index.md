# DLF Base

Use this template to keep your pages consistent with the rest of Digital Land.

The [dlf-base.html]() template extends the [GOV.UK template]()

The default max width is 1020px (with margins the content width is 960px). You can make it wider if needed. Using the dlf-base--full-width.html template is another option.

    "size": "xl"
},
"example": {
    "path": "digital-land/templates/dlf-base"
}
}) }}
