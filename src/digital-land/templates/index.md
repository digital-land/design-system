# Templates

We use a number of jinja templates to generate the pages on the [digital land site](https://digital-land.github.io/).

If you are creating any pages for digital land, you should try to use one of the available templates. At a minimum you should extend on of the base templates. We have 2 main base templates to use depending on your need.

* [dlf-base.html](dlf-base) - the main base template. It is customisable but provides you with the basic building blocks you will need.
* dlf-base--full-width.html - this makes the page wider than the standard 960px. It should be used when you need to make a page that needs to make full use of the available width, for example when generating a map to display a lot of data.
